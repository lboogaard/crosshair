# crosshair
A simple module to add a crosshair marker to matplotlib.

It is currently being tested and expanded, before pushing it to the matplotlib repository.

Feel free to contribute!

## Usage

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import crosshair
    plt.scatter(0,0, marker='c', s=100)
    plt.show()
